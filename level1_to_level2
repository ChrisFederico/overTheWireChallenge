# The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

Solution:

Files starting with (-) character have particular behavior, if you simply type "cat -" on the command line,
nothing will happen. This is because, according to the standard POSIX, if (-) is the file argument of cat, the program
will start reading from standard input 
(You can find more about it here: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2018edition/utilities/cat.html). 

In this case we have to prefix "./" to the file name.

~$ cat ./-
