# The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

Solution:

In this exercise you are in the home directory, so just move into the inhere directory in order to find the file with
the password. However, if you type the ls command, you'll notice that there are no files in the folder.
No worries, the file is just hidden, to reveal it add the -a option to the ls command and cat the content on the
standard output.

~$ cd inhere
~$ ls -a
~$ cat .hidden
