# The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:

# owned by user bandit7
# owned by group bandit6
# 33 bytes in size

Solution:

This one is easy and similar to the previous exercise, the only two things we have to keep in mind are the first two
requirements, I'm pretty sure this is not the best way to proceed and I'll be glad to improve my solution, still, you can
achieve the challenge anyway.

As the previous challenge, using the find command piped with xargs we can craft a command in order to display a list of all
the files stored that match the requirements: just use find / -type f -size 33c in order to get all the files from the root
directory that match 33 bytes in size. In order to match group and owner we can use two other options from the find command,
first one is -user and the second one is -group, just type the owner name and the group name that you are looking for
(respectevely bandit7 and bandit6) and you're done.

Notice that you have a list of files you don't have permissions to access to, in order to find the one that you need in this
list, you can pipe xargs with the ls -la command, so you can display the owner and the group in the list and get the path
of the file with the password. Finally just cat the content of the file you need.

~$ find / -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 | xargs ls -la
