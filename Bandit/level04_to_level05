# The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. 
# Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

Solution:

I didn't need the reset command, so make sure you don't actually mess up your terminal. The point is that you need to find 
the file with human readable characters in it, and there are 10 files where you have to look in. Since bruteforcing is
always discouraged, you can pipe a few of commands to filter and print directly the name of the file you are looking for.
The first command is find (search for files in a directory hierarchy - from "man find"), the second command is xargs, which
runs a command taking as argument the output from standard input. 

The trick is using the file command, which determines the type of a file, using the output of the find command.

# move into inhere directory
~$ cd inhere

# this is where the magic happens: use find passing as argument the current directory (.) and the f value into the type option
# to remark that you are looking for a file and not a directory, then pipe the result with xargs using the file command
~/inhere$ find . -type f | xargs file
