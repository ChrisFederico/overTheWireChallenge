# The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, 
# beginning with several ‘=’ characters.

This one is easy too, you have an executable file so is not possible to cat is content, however you can use strings command
in order to print every human-readable character into the file. You can also simplify things piping grep and search for
several '=' characters and the output will be a bit clearer.

~$ cat data.txt | grep ===
