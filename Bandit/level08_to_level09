# The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

Solution:

This one is a bit more interesting but is not very hard. You have a file called data.txt in which there are stored a
lot of passwords, all of them except one (the right one) are duplicates; in order to find the one that occurs only once,
we can pipe two commands that you can find in the hints: sort and uniq.

The first one, as the name suggests, sorts lines of text in a text file; the second one omits every repeated line. Uniq also
has an option -u which allows us to print only the lines that are not duplicated, so theoretically we could just use this
command and resolve the challenge. Still - according to the manual (man uniq) - "'uniq'  does  not  detect  repeated  lines 
unless they are adjacent. You may want to sort the input first", that's why we need sort command.

As we said before, piping these two commands will print on our terminal the password that we are looking for.

~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u
