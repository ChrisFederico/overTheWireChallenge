# The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has 
# all of the following properties:

# human-readable
# 1033 bytes in size
# not executable

Solution:

In this exercise you have a directory called inhere, in which there are 20 subfolders with ~10 text files in each of them.
In this situation we can assert that bruteforcing is out of discussion, but still there are a few tricks you can use to find out
just the folder and the file that you need.

Fortunately, the find command has a couple of useful options in order to search into the directories and list the path that we
need, we just have to stick to the parameters given in the challenge. So for each of them we have the proper option:
- human-readable: just as the previous level, we can use the find command piped with xargs + file command to get all the files
with ASCII text property;

- 1033 bytes in size: we can specify this property using the -size option of the file command and the value, however, according
to the description provided from "man find", we must "bear in mind that the size is rounded up to the next unit. 
Therefore -size -1M is not equivalent to -size -1048576c". Nothing to worry about as we can simply specify 1033c as value for
the -size option (although you can find more about size managing in the manual page of the command). 

- not executable: this can be achieved using the -executable option of the find command, remember that we are looking for
files that are NOT executable, so we just prefix the negation operand (!) before the option.

~$ cd inhere
~/inhere$ find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable | xargs file
~/inhere$ cat the_name_of_the_path
