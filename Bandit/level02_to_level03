# The password for the next level is stored in a file called "spaces in this filename" located in the home directory

Solution:

Spaces are tricky in unix terminals, if you use cd or cat commands to access directories or files with spaces in its name, 
the result will be a "no such file or directory error". To write these particular file names, use the \ character before 
every space.

~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
